Project using HTML to create website about food recipes

I will try to use HTML to create a website using links to multiple webpages. Try to utilize different sized headers, created unordered and orderd lists, embed images, and format paragraphs.
Other things I have so far learned about HTML include hyperlinks and bold/italic writing modifiers.
